## Research Design

**Mixed-Methods Approach:** Combines personal stories (interviews) with broader patterns (survey) for complete understanding.

| Component | Purpose | Sample Size | Duration |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Interviews** | Deep personal insights | 15 participants | 35 minutes |
| **Survey** | Demographic patterns | 200+ responses | 4-6 minutes |

## What We're Researching

**Cultural Variation:** How traditional practices and family influences shape approaches to stillness

**Technology Impact:** Digital habits, generational differences, and challenges finding quiet today

**Personal Meaning:** Individual definitions of stillness, stress management, and well-being connections

**Demographics:** Age patterns, cultural backgrounds, and environmental factors (urban vs rural)
