## It's Just a Conversation

Interviews are **relaxed conversations, not questionnaires**. We'll explore topics based on your experiences and interests.

**No preparation needed** - just bring your authentic perspective.

## What We Might Discuss

### Your Experience with Stillness
• How you define quiet moments
• Times when stillness has been meaningful to you
• How you create peaceful moments in daily life

### Background and Culture
• Family attitudes toward quiet time and rest
• Cultural or religious traditions involving reflection
• How your community views "doing nothing"

### Technology and Modern Life
• How devices affect your quiet time
• Strategies for digital boundaries
• Generational differences you've noticed

### Personal Meaning
• What stillness means to you
• Benefits or challenges of quiet moments
• Role in managing stress or finding peace

## You're in Control

• **Share what feels comfortable** - you control the conversation
• **Focus on topics that interest you** most
• **Ask questions** about the research
• **Skip anything** that doesn't resonate

## All Perspectives Welcome

Whether you love stillness, struggle with it, or have mixed feelings - your experience matters and contributes to understanding how people relate to quiet in today's world.
