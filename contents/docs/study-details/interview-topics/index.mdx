Natural conversation topics that emerge based on your experiences and interests.

## It's Really Just a Conversation

Interviews are **conversations, not questionnaires**. The specific direction depends on your experiences, background, and what interests you most.

**No preparation needed** - come with your authentic experiences and perspectives.

## Main Discussion Areas

### Personal Experiences

| Topic | Example Questions |
|-------|------------------|
| **Defining Stillness** | How do you personally define quiet moments? |
| **Meaningful Moments** | Can you describe a time you experienced meaningful stillness? |
| **Daily Practices** | How do you create quiet time in your routine? |
| **Changes Over Time** | Has your relationship with stillness evolved? |

### Cultural Background

**We might explore:**
• Family influences on quiet time and rest
• Cultural or religious traditions involving contemplation
• Community attitudes toward stillness and "doing nothing"
• Generational differences in contemplative practices
• Traditional practices and how they've evolved

### Technology & Modern Life

| Area | Discussion Points |
|------|------------------|
| **Digital Impact** | How do devices affect your quiet time? |
| **Boundary Setting** | What strategies help you disconnect? |
| **Generational Differences** | How do age groups approach technology differently? |
| **Environmental Factors** | What supports or hinders stillness in your life? |

### Personal Meaning & Well-being

**We might discuss:**
• What stillness means to you personally
• Benefits or challenges of quiet moments

• "What helps you create boundaries with digital devices?"
• "Have you noticed generational differences in approaching technology and quiet time?"

### If You Focus on Personal Well-being:
• "What role does stillness play in managing stress?"
• "How do you intentionally create peaceful moments?"
• "What environments best support your need for quiet?"
