## Mixed-Methods Design

Sequential approach combining personal interviews and anonymous surveys for comprehensive understanding.

## Interview Component

| Detail | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Duration** | 35 minutes |
| **Format** | Semi-structured conversation |
| **Platform** | Zoom or Google Meet |
| **Recording** | Audio only (with consent) |
| **Target Sample** | 15 diverse participants |

### Interview Approach
• Open-ended questions encouraging storytelling
• Culturally responsive questioning
• Flexible adaptation based on participant background
• Narrative inquiry methodology

### Diversity Goals
**Target Demographics:**
• Various cultural/ethnic groups
• Age range 14-65+
• Different life experiences and backgrounds
• Urban, suburban, and rural perspectives
• Range of technology relationships

## Survey Component

| Detail | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Duration** | 4-6 minutes |
| **Platform** | Google Forms |
| **Format** | Multiple choice, rating scales |
| **Languages** | English (others available) |
| **Target Sample** | 200+ responses |

### Survey Sections
1. **Demographics** (optional)
2. **Stillness Experiences** - frequency, types, settings
3. **Cultural Background** - traditions and practices
4. **Technology Use** - digital habits and impact
5. **Well-being** - connection to quiet moments
6. **Open Response** - additional insights

### Sample Size Goals
• **Target**: 200+ responses for statistical analysis
• **Recruitment**: Social media, community organizations, educational institutions
• **Accessibility**: Mobile-optimized, screen reader compatible

## Data Analysis Plan

### Qualitative Analysis
• **Transcription**: Professional service with accuracy verification
• **Coding**: Thematic analysis using established principles
• **Software**: NVivo or similar qualitative analysis platform
• **Validation**: Member checking with participant feedback on themes

### Quantitative Analysis
• **Software**: R or SPSS for statistical analysis
• **Methods**: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, cross-tabulation
• **Visualization**: Charts and graphs for accessible presentation
• **Integration**: Quantitative findings inform qualitative theme development

## Ethical Considerations

### IRB-Style Protocols
• **Informed Consent**: Comprehensive consent process for all participants
• **Confidentiality**: Pseudonyms and data de-identification
• **Data Security**: Encrypted storage and secure transmission
• **Participant Rights**: Right to withdraw, skip questions, review transcripts

### Cultural Sensitivity
• **Respectful Inquiry**: Questions designed to honor diverse experiences
• **Inclusive Language**: Terminology reviewed for accessibility and inclusivity
• **Community Partnership**: Collaboration with cultural organizations where appropriate
• **Reciprocity**: Findings shared back with participating communities

## Quality Assurance

### Rigor Measures
• **Reflexivity**: Researcher positionality acknowledgment
• **Triangulation**: Multiple data sources and analysis methods
• **Peer Review**: Academic mentor oversight and feedback
• **Transparency**: Clear documentation of methods and limitations

### Study Limitations
• Geographic concentration in specific regions
• Potential selection bias toward individuals interested in stillness
• Language limitations (primarily English-speaking participants)
• Time constraints of college-prep research timeline
