## Rushil Mahadevu
*Student Researcher, Reno, Nevada*

High school student exploring how people experience stillness in our modern world.

### Why This Research Matters to Me
> "Stillness matters to me because it represents those rare, minimal moments where the chaotic world we live in fades away and the thoughts we spend so much energy avoiding finally surface and demand our attention."

I'm curious about how different people find and experience quiet moments, especially across different cultures and generations.

## Research Focus

**What I'm Exploring:**
• How people define and experience stillness
• Cultural differences in approaching quiet time
• Technology's impact on our ability to be still
• Personal strategies for finding peace in busy lives

**Why This Matters:**
• Understanding diverse approaches to finding calm
• Learning from different cultural wisdom about rest and reflection
• Exploring how modern life affects our relationship with quiet

## Academic Approach

This college-preparatory project demonstrates rigorous research methods while prioritizing participant voices and community benefit.

**Timeline:** July - November 2025
