## Rushil Mahadevu
*Student Researcher, Reno, Nevada*

High school student exploring the intersection of culture, psychology, and silence in our modern world through The Stillness Project.

### Research Philosophy
> "Stillness matters to me because it represents those rare, minimal moments where the chaotic world we live in fades away and the thoughts we spend so much energy avoiding finally surface and demand our attention. There's something profound about this involuntary confrontation with ourselves. It's simultaneously the most natural and most terrifying human experience."


Guided by curiosity and driven by empathy, this research seeks to understand how people across different backgrounds experience stillness as both pause and presence.
